# robo-weedeater

This project was created to showcase a off-road implimentation of a kiwi drivetrain, a holonomic system of travel which only uses 3 wheels. Historically, this type of movement was limited to very flat surfaces, which is totally lame. The classic style of drive looks like this:

This new drive, what I like to call Kiwi Ball Drive, looks like this:

To showcase this drivetrain, and you might be able to tell this from the above picture, a simple lawn mowing blade was attached to the bottom of the robot. This code isn't perfect, but it successfully displays the ability of this drive system using an xBox controller and proves its usefulness. I have the most updated parts files  on [my gitlab page](https://gitlab.com/ntatko/js_mower) under the hardware tab, along with a parts list on the most current iteration of the project. This is the old version of the project, it new version can be found at the included link.
